# OxCellTrack

OxCellTrack represents a software package developed in the scope of Third Year Design Project at Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford.

The software performs cell tracking and it is capable to deal with both transmission and fluorescence microscopy datasets.

The software provides:
-segmentation of cells
-cell counting
-information about cell trajectories
-data augmentation for biomedical images

In the scope of the team project, Advanced photonics platform that is capable of imaging and fabricating cell scaffolds is designed.

OxCellTrack provides in-depth information about the scaffoldâ€™s vital functions such as growth anddynamics of the cells and scaffolding structures.  As a final result, the software is able to tell whetherthe fabrication process was successful and whether the scaffold design can be used outside the scopeof the platform in applications such as tissue engineering.
