# OxCellTrack
(author:K.Petrovic)\
**OxCellTrack** represents a software package developed in the scope of Third Year Design Project at Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford.:woman_student: :man_student:

The software performs **cell tracking** :dna: and it is capable of dealing with both **transmission** and **fluorescence** microscopy datasets. :microscope: :raised_hands:. The softare provides
-segmentation of cells
-cell counting
-information about cell trajectories
-data augmentation for biomedical images

In the scope of the team project, Advanced photonics platform that is capable of imaging and fabricating cell scaffolds is designed.

OxCellTrack provides in-depth information about the scaffoldâ€™s vital functions such as growth anddynamics of the cells and scaffolding structures.  As a final result, the software is able to tell whetherthe fabrication process was successful :white_check_mark: and whether the scaffold design can be used outside the scope of the platform in applications such as tissue engineering. :woman_health_worker: :man_health_worker:

Python :snake: and MATLAB :chart_with_upwards_trend: are used as platforms for coding!

Platform is tested on Mouse stem cells GOWT1 and Glioblastoma-U373 datasets that can be found on http://celltrackingchallenge.net/2d-datasets/ 
Check out this repo and please leave comments if you are interested to hear more about the platform that is designed!
